LazyHunter Pro v2.0
Elite Web Application & Infrastructure Recon Assistant

LazyHunter Pro is a high-speed, asynchronous reconnaissance tool designed for bug hunters to quickly map the attack surface of a target IP or range. It leverages Shodan's InternetDB for lightning-fast port and vulnerability discovery and the CVEDB API for deep contextual analysis.

🚀 Key Features
Asynchronous Processing: Scans hundreds of targets simultaneously using asyncio and aiohttp.


Intelligent CVE Caching: Minimizes API calls by caching CVE details locally, preventing rate-limiting.


Exploit Correlation: Generates direct links to Exploit-DB for every identified vulnerability to speed up Proof-of-Concept (PoC) development.

Nuclei Ready: Automatically generates a nuclei_targets.txt file (formatted as IP:Port) for immediate active scanning.

Hostname Resolution: Identifies reverse DNS records to help prioritize high-value assets (e.g., prod vs dev servers).

🛠 Prerequisites
Before running the tool, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

1. System Requirements

Python 3.8+: The script uses modern async features.

Internet Access: Required to reach internetdb.shodan.io and cvedb.shodan.io.

2. Python Dependencies
Install the required libraries using pip:

Bash
pip install aiohttp
3. (Optional) External Tools
For a professional workflow, it is recommended to have these tools installed:

Nuclei: For active vulnerability verification.

jq: For processing the JSON reports generated by LazyHunter.

📖 How to Use
1. Scanning a Single IP
Quickly audit a single target:


python3 lazyhunter.py -i 192.168.0.69


2. Scanning a List of Targets
Provide a file containing one IP per line for mass reconnaissance:


python3 lazyhunter.py -f ips.txt
